            typescript(does type checking to catch errors early on, say no if you just want plain javascript)

            ESlint (checks for bad formatting or potential bugs, keeps the code clean and consistent)

            tailwind css (modern and efficient UI styling)

            src/ (Saying Yes puts all main files inside a /src folder(eg. src/pages/index.js),helps organize large codebases better)

            app router (Uses the /app directory instead of the older /pages for routing. Gives advanced features like layout nesting, server components, and better performance.)

            turbopack (new, faster bundler for web dev)
        
        now necessary packages will get installed.
